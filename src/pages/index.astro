				<p>I'm Mayphus Tang, a maker and perpetual learner
          whose passion lies at the vibrant intersection of technology and creative craftsmanship.
          My workshop is a testament to this diverse approach – you'll find 3D printers humming alongside
          soldering stations, microcontrollers sharing space with fabric swatches,
          and engineering notebooks filled with sketches ranging from circuit designs to sewing patterns.</p>

				<p>My journey spans multiple disciplines, each enriching the others:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Mechanical Engineering: From precision mechanisms to robust machine designs</li>
					<li>Electronics: Creating custom circuits and interactive systems</li>
					<li>Computer Science: Writing code that give machines life</li>
					<li>3D Printing: Transforming ideas into tangible prototypes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>What drives me is more than just making things – it's understanding the deeper patterns that connect different fields.
          I find profound inspiration in nature's designs, whether it's studying the structural efficiency of a honeycomb
          or the distributed intelligence of mycelial networks.
          These observations often inform my approach to problem-solving,
          reminding me that the most elegant solutions usually mirror patterns found in the natural world.</p>

				<p>My projects reflect this interdisciplinary mindset. You might find me developing a smart garden system one day,
          designing a custom 3D-printed enclosure the next, and then integrating both with hand-sewn sensors.
          Each project is an opportunity to learn something new and combine techniques in unexpected ways.</p>

				<p>Through this website, I share:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Detailed Project Documentation: Following the journey from concept to completion</li>
					<li>Technical Tutorials: Making complex topics accessible while preserving their depth</li>
					<li>Design Insights: Exploring the thinking behind successful (and failed) projects</li>
					<li>Resource Collections: Curated tools and references for fellow makers</li>
					<li>Philosophical Musings: Examining how technology and craftsmanship shape our world</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I believe strongly in the power of open knowledge and community learning.
          Every article, tutorial, and project log here is crafted not just to showcase the end result,
          but to illuminate the learning process itself. I share both successes and failures,
          believing that understanding why something didn't work is often as valuable as knowing what did.</p>

				<p>This space is more than just a portfolio or blog – it's a living workshop of ideas.
          Whether you're a seasoned maker, a curious beginner, or someone who simply enjoys seeing how things come together,
          I hope you'll find something here that sparks your own creative journey.</p>

				<p>I'm always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts and learners.
          Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the tutorials, or reach out to share your own making adventures.
          After all, the best innovations often emerge from unexpected collaborations and shared insights.</p>

				<p>Let's build, learn, and discover together.</p>

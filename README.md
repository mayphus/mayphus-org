# mayphus.org

This repository contains the source code for [mayphus.org](https://mayphus.org/), my personal website built with modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) - The web framework for content-driven websites
- [uniorg](https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg) - An accurate Org-mode parser for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Project Philosophy

The website is built with the following principles in mind:

- **Content-First**: Prioritizing meaningful content over flashy design
- **Minimalist Design**: Using clean, minimal CSS styling for optimal readability
- **Feature-Rich but Clean**: Maintaining a balance between functionality and simplicity
